# One-Class SVM Hyperparameter Tuning and Training
Description:
This repository contains code for hyperparameter tuning and training of a One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) for anomaly detection. Anomaly detection is a critical task in various fields, such as cybersecurity, fraud detection, and quality control. One-Class SVM is a machine learning algorithm used for this purpose, and this repository provides a comprehensive approach to finding the best hyperparameters for the model and saving the trained model for future use.
